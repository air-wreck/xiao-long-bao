    <h5>THE MODERN CLASSIC</h5>
    <p>Vinegar is a classic staple that goes well with xiao long bao. According to Wikipedia, Chinese black vinegar is an aged product made from rice, wheat, millet, sorghum, or a combination thereof. This vinegar is less acidic than its Western counterpart, making it the perfect match for a meal.</p>
    <p>It's a simple formula:</p>
    <p>

      (happiness!)

    <h2>Simple. Elegant. Refined.</h2>
    <p>Vinegar is unique because of its beautifully complex simplicity. If that doesn't make sense, it's because it wasn't supposed to.</p>
    <p>Vinegar's sophisticated taste is too difficult to describe in a simple, Hemingway-esque statement. It is precisely this complex interaction of chemicals that produces the signature slightly acidic and sharply salty taste that pairs so excellently with xiao long bao.</p>

    <h2>The Data Do Support</h2>
    <p>Thorough and rigorous scientific studies conducted by world-famous biologist Professor Nelson Lin speak to vinegar's timeless ability to hold diners captive with its complex aromas. In the latest study, <i>On Oriental Dining Preferences with Respect to Optimal Condiment Pairing with Xiao Long Bao</i>, Prof. Lin determined that vinegar is truly the ideal way to consume Xiao Long Bao. The study included a (not) statistically sound sample completely representative of the entire global population. In the study, most respondents reported that they consumed xiao long bao with some sort of condiment, and of those who said so, the majority reported vinegar as their favorite or among their favorites.</p>
